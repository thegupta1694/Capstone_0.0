### 2. Functional Requirements (Scope for Version 1.0)

#### 2.1. Student Profile
*   **Authentication:** Secure login using university portal credentials.
*   **Team Formation:**
    *   A student can create a team, becoming the team leader.
    *   Invite up to 3 teammates via their unique university ID or email.
    *   Invitations are confirmed via an OTP or a unique confirmation link.
    *   View team status and all members.
*   **Professor Discovery:**
    *   View and search a list of all available professors.
    *   Filter professors by name, department, and research domains (tags).
    *   View a professor's detailed profile, including their available project slots.
*   **Application Management:**
    *   A team can submit applications to professors.
    *   A team can have a maximum of **4 live (pending) applications** at any time.
    *   View the status of all submitted applications (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
    *   Ability to withdraw a pending application.
    *   Once an application is accepted, all other pending applications for that team are automatically withdrawn.

#### 2.2. Teacher (Professor) Profile
*   **Authentication:** Secure login with university credentials.
*   **Profile Management:**
    *   Update personal details and research domains.
    *   Set and dynamically update the number of available project slots.
*   **Application Dashboard:**
    *   View all incoming team applications in a clean, filterable list.
    *   Review the details of each applicant team.
    *   **Accept** or **Reject** applications with one click.
    *   Accepting an application decrements the available slot count. The system prevents accepting more applications than available slots.

#### 2.3. Admin Profile
*   **Authentication:** Secure login with admin credentials.
*   **Dashboard & Analytics:**
    *   View key statistics: Total students, teams formed, applications submitted, and the percentage of students successfully allocated.
    *   See a real-time list of professors and their current slot-fill status.
*   **User & System Management:**
    *   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all data (Users, Teams, Applications).
    *   Ability to manually override allocations or resolve conflicts.
    *   Set system-wide parameters like application start/end dates.

### 3. Technical Architecture

#### 3.1. Chosen Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** **React.js** (with a UI library like **Material-UI**)
    *   *Why?* Component-based architecture for a manageable and scalable UI. Massive ecosystem and community support.
*   **Backend:** **Python** with the **Django** framework (using Django Rest Framework for the API).
    *   *Why?* Django's built-in Admin Panel is a massive accelerator for the Admin profile. Its ORM is robust and works perfectly with relational data. Python is a common language in academic environments.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL**
    *   *Why?* A powerful, open-source relational database that perfectly models the structured relationships between students, teams, professors, and applications.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Frontend on **Vercel/Netlify**.
    *   Backend & Database on **Heroku/Render**.

### 5. Tools & Best Practices

*   **Version Control:** **Git**. All work must be done on feature branches (`feature/login-page`) and merged into `main` via Pull Requests.
*   **Task Management:** A Kanban board (e.g., **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Jira**) to track the status of all tasks.
*   **Communication:** A dedicated channel on **Slack** or **Discord** for team communication.
*   **Design:** **Figma** for collaborative UI/UX design and wireframing.
*   **API Testing:** **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test backend endpoints independently of the frontend.
